\details{
Long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) based RNN is designed to overcome the vanishing gradients problem while dealing with long term dependencies. In contrast to standard RNN, LSTM has this peculiar and unique inbuilt ability by maintaining a memory cell to determine which unimportant features should be forgotten and which important features should be remembered during the learning process (Jaiswal et al., 2022). An LSTM model analyses and captures both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies of a complex time series effectively due to its architecture of recurrent neural network and the memory function used in the hidden nodes.
